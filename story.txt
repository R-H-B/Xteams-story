There once was a man named Bob. He lived in a shoe and ate rocks.

Due to his rock eating habit, there was always something wrong with Bob's teeth. He had to visit his dentist quite often. Bob's dentist loved him, as he made so much money off of Bob's weekly dental reconstructions, but Bob hated his dentist for an endless amount of reasons.
