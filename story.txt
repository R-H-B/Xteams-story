There once was a man named Bob. He lived in a shoe and ate rocks.

Due to his rock eating habit, there was always something wrong with Bob's teeth. He had to visit his dentist quite often. Bob's dentist loved him, as he made so much money off of Bob's weekly dental reconstructions, but Bob hated his dentist for an endless amount of reasons. One day Bob devised a plan. He was going to sabotage his dentist. To do this, Bob needed 3 things. A shoe lace, a leaf, and finally a piece of paper. And so, Bob set out on his quest for the items.

Bob wanted to get the shoe lace. The only way to have that was by jumping out from the shoe and pull the shoe lace. However, there was one problem. He had to face with the giant ant. Because of that, he worked out tirelessly days and nights to build muscles. The next day he fought with the giant ant. He was scrapped to pieces but that was alright since he was able to pull the shoe lace. Bob was extravagant and later he worked on other plans.

He then realized that his feud was unfounded. There was no reason for him to hurt his dentist. He decided that he was a better person for it and lived happily ever after.
